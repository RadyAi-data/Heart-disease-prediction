# Heart-disease-prediction

This project aims to predict heart disease risk using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the heart disease dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models
- `ui/`: Streamlit web application for predictions
- `deployment/`: Deployment configuration files
- `results/`: Evaluation metrics and results

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run ui/app.py`
